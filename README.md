# Medical_Supply_Chain_Management

### üéØ **Project Objectives**

The primary goal was to provide actionable insights for a business to optimize its medical logistics. The analysis addresses three key business questions:

1.  **Logistics Performance:** What are the average delivery times, and what is the overall on-time delivery rate?
2.  **Cost & Financial Analysis:** What factors drive our freight costs, and where are our most significant expenses?
3.  **Vendor Performance:** Which vendors are the most and least reliable for on-time delivery?

### üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies & Skills**

* **Excel:** Used for initial data cleaning and preparation.
* **Python:** Utilized for a deeper exploratory data analysis (EDA) and to calculate key metrics.
* **Pandas, Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Core libraries for efficient data handling and creating static visualizations.
* **Power BI:** Employed to design and build a dynamic and interactive dashboard for presenting key findings.
* **Generative AI:** Leveraged as a collaborative tool to accelerate the project's development.

### üìà **Key Insights & Outcomes**

* **On-Time Delivery:** The overall on-time delivery rate was calculated and visualized, providing a clear performance metric.
* **Cost Drivers:** Correlation analysis revealed that `Line Item Value` and `Line Item Quantity` were the strongest drivers of freight cost, not `Weight`.
* **Vendor Performance:** A metric was created to rank vendors by their on-time delivery rate, filtered to only include those with a significant number of shipments, identifying the most reliable partners.
