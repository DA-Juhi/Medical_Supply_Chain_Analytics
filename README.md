# Medical_Supply_Chain_Management

### üéØ **Project Objectives**

The primary goal was to provide actionable insights for a business to optimize its medical logistics. The analysis addresses three key business questions:

1.  **Logistics Performance:** What are the average delivery times, and what is the overall on-time delivery rate?
2.  **Cost & Financial Analysis:** What factors drive our freight costs, and where are our most significant expenses?
3.  **Vendor Performance:** Which vendors are the most and least reliable for on-time delivery?

### üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies & Skills**

* **Excel:** Used for initial data cleaning and preparation.
* **Python:** Utilized for a deeper exploratory data analysis (EDA) and to calculate key metrics.
* **Pandas, Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Core libraries for efficient data handling and creating static visualizations.
* **Power BI:** Employed to design and build a dynamic and interactive dashboard for presenting key findings.
* **Generative AI:** Leveraged as a collaborative tool to accelerate the project's development.

### üìà **Key Insights & Outcomes**
1. **Data Quality:** We identified over 1,736 missing values in the dosage data. This was not an error but a key insight: the missing values were for test kits, which are not measured in dosages.

2. **Delivery Performance:** Our deliveries are on time 88.51% of the time. We see a clear difference in speed: trucks are the fastest at 55 days, while ocean is the slowest at 176 days.

3. **Cost Drivers:** We found that the value of the items in a shipment has a stronger impact on the shipping cost than the actual weight of the package.

4. **Financial Outliers:** The most expensive shipments are almost always air and air charter deliveries. This is where we should look for potential cost savings.

5. **Top Markets:** Our highest volume of shipments is to key countries like South Africa, Nigeria, and Vietnam, giving us a clear focus for business strategy.
